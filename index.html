            <!--One kind of review.-->
            <h3><strong>---Reception--</strong></h3>
            <p><strong><em>Tamana Khan</em></strong> wrote in her review for <strong>The Daily Star</strong>  wrote that it was a "commendable effort to bring something entertaining for children but one that could have been done with a little more finesse". She praised the attempt but felt the adaption did not develop the relationship between the characters by leaving out some of the scenes from the book. <strong>The Daily Star</strong> placed it on a list of "essential Bangla movies for children" list in 2015 and on a list of 5 "memorable films" on the Bangladesh Liberation war in 2017. It has 8.2 stars on Imdb from 2463 ratings.</p>
